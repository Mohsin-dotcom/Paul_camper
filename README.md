Hi, I have completed the take home task by here are some details regarding the working.

<li> To run the project and see output please run (node Task.js) command in terminal.  </li>
<li> I have used fetch in Node.js as it was a requirement.</li>
<li> Task.js is the main file which holds all the code for assignment.</li>
<li> renderCampers() is the function that executes and gets us the final output. </li>
<li> I have tried to make a separate function for each of the module to keep the code clean </li>
<li> The reason why I have kept the API_URL and requestOptions in the same file is because it generally depends on the project size. 
<li> If the project had two or more API calls I would have moved these entities to the constants folder. </li> </li>
<li> sorting function could also be moved to a separate file but according to the requirement I chose to go with this way </li>
<li> I went with the reduce function to group campers by catergory as it is quite easy to understand. </li>
<li> In the end I chose to go with for-in loop instead of for-of because its quite easy to understand by a third person. </li>
<li> If you have any questions or recommendations regarding the chosen flow or the code structure. I'd love to hear that. Thank you. </li>
