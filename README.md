Hi, I have completed the take home task by here are some details regarding the working.

---> To run the project and see output please run (node Task.js) command in terminal. 
---> I have used fetch in Node.js as it was a requirement. 
---> Task.js is the main file which holds all the code for assignment.
---> renderCampers() is the function that executes and gets us the final output.
---> I have tried to make a separate function for each of the module to keep the code clean
---> The reason why I have kept the API_URL and requestOptions in the same file is because it generally depends on the project size. if the project had two or more API calls I would have moved these entities to the constants folder.
---> sorting function could also be moved to a separate file but according to the requirement I chose to go with this way
---> I went with the reduce function to group campers by catergory as it is quite easy to understand.
---> In the end I chose to go with for-in loop instead of for-of because its quite easy to understand by a third person.
---> If you have any questions or recommendations regarding the chosen flow or the code structure. I'd love to hear that. Thank you.
